# EDD-calculator

This is a GUI program created using Python Tkinter Module.

The program computes the expected date of delivery of a user when they enter the date of their last menstrual period.

Full program runs on app.py

I made a blog post about the process. Check it out here https://themedtechie.com/2021/12/21/building-gui-with-tkinter/.
